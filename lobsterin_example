! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level):
COHPStartEnergy -10
COHPEndEnergy 5
!
! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use:
includeOrbitals s p d
! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.:
! basisFunctions Ga 4s 4p
! basisFunctions Sr 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
!
! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done.
! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file.
cohpBetween atom 1 atom 10
!
! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs
! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:
! cohpBetween atom 1 atom 2 orbitalWise
!
! If you are interested in a bond that involves an atom that is not located
! in the original but in a neighboring unit cell, you can shift it using the
! cell keyword
!
! cohpBetween atom 1 atom 2 cell 1 0 0
!
!
!
! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include
! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
! If you want to transfer the LCAO basis set into a molecular- or fragment-
! orbital basis set, you can tell LOBSTER to combine any number of atoms:
! molecule atom 1 atom 2 atom 3 cell 1 0 0
! If molecules or fragments are defined, COHP pairs can be generated as
! follows:
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ca type CO3
! Note that the type definition of molecules is case sensitive!
! E.g., CO will be interpreted as carbon monoxide, Co as cobalt.
! The order of atoms is arbitrary: E.g., CO3 = COOO = O3C = O2CO; and so on
